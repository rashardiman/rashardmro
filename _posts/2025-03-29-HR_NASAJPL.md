# Longtime Southern California NASA engineer, space mission manager dies at 92 [![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/badge/Social-@KTLA__-blue?style=social&logo=X)](https://twitter.com/@KTLA)
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Casani) : [Talk @whitehouse @nasa @nasa-jpl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_R._Casani) : [NASAWATCH.cOm John Casani (Update)](https://nasawatch.com/personnel-news/john-casani/)
John R. Casani, a longtime Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineer, project manager and researcher, died at the age of 92 last week. 

Casani served a central role in many of NASA’s historic deep space missions, the space agency said in a statement.  

Born in Philadelphia in 1932, Casani studied electrical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and worked at an Air Force research lab before he moved to SoCal to work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), located on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, way back in 1956, two years before NASA itself was formed. 

He went on to become an engineer on some of America’s earliest spacecraft after initially working on missiles. He worked on the design team for the Ranger and Mariner series of spacecraft and was a payload engineer on Pioneer 3 and 4 – NASA’s first two missions to the moon; he was tasked with the very important job of carrying each of the 20-inch probes in a suitcase from JPL to the launch site in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where he installed them in the rocket’s nose cone.

By the time the mid 1960s rolled around, Casani had established himself as a “meticulous” worker and started working on the design team for the Mariner project. Shortly after, he helped lead NASA’s flagship mission to the outer planets and beyond: Voyager, which is still active today. 

“He not only led the mission from clean room to space, he was first to envision attaching a message representing humanity to any alien civilization that might encounter humanity’s first interstellar emissaries,” NASA’s statement reads.

Casani presented that idea to famed astronomer Carl Sagan, who ended up making the “Golden Record,” a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on earth, according to NASA.  

Voyager 1 and 2 both launched in 1977, meaning that Casani – described as “an engineer’s engineer” — was quickly shuttled to the Galileo team, the first mission to orbit a gas giant planet. He led the project from inception to assembly while navigating several attempts by Congress to end the project.

After leading Galileo for 11 years, Casani became a deputy assistant laboratory director for flight projects in 1988 before being promoted just over a year later to serve as project manager of Cassini, which was NASA’s flagship mission to orbit Saturn. He was then named as JPL’s first chief engineer in 1994, a role in which he served for five years before retiring, temporarily. 

In retirement, Casani served on several committees and helped conduct investigations into the Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander failures. He also led the James Webb Space Telescope Independent Comprehensive Review Panel.

By 2003, however, Casani was back at JPL serving as project manager for Project Prometheus, which was the first attempt at nuclear-powered systems for long-range missions. The project was canceled in 2005.  

After the cancelation of Prometheus, Casani was appointed as the manager of the Institutional Special Projects Office at JPL, which was a position he held until his second retirement in 2012.

“[John’s] work helped advance NASA spacecraft in areas including mechanical technology, system design and integration, software and deep space communication,” NASA’s statement reads. “No less demanding were the management challenges of these multifaceted missions, which led to innovations still in use today.” 

Charles Elachi, the JPL director from 2001 through 2016, said Casani “reflected the true spirit of JPL.” 

“He was bold, innovative, visionary and welcoming,” Elachi said in the NASA statement. “He was an undisputed leader with an upbeat, fun attitude and left an indelible mark on the laboratory and NASA. I am proud to have called him a friend.”

In addition to his impressive résumé, Casani received many awards throughout his long career, including NASA’s Exceptional Achievement Medal and the Air and Space Museum Trophy for Lifetime Achievement. He also received an honorary doctorate from the Sapienza University of Rome.

The 92-year-old, who died Thursday, is survived by his wife of 39 years, Lynn, and their five sons. A cause of death was not revealed.

## Forms_of_wartime_violence
# Wartime Sexual Violence [WiKi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartime_sexual_violence) [Genocidal rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocidal_rape) [War rape - psychology.fandom](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/War_rape)
 <img src="https://16days.thepixelproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/War-rape.jpg" style="width:400px;height:600px;margin-left:15px;" align="right" alt="Pineapple" /> 
<p>Wartime sexual violence is rape or other forms of sexual violence committed by combatants during armed conflict, war, or military occupation often as spoils of war, but sometimes, particularly in ethnic conflict, the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. Wartime sexual violence may also include gang rape and rape with objects. A war crime, it is distinguished from sexual harassment, sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service.[1][2][3]</p>
<p>During war and armed conflict, rape is frequently used as a means of psychological warfare in order to humiliate the enemy. Wartime sexual violence may occur in a variety of situations, including institutionalized sexual slavery, wartime sexual violence associated with specific battles or massacres, as well as individual or isolated acts of sexual violence.</p>
<p>Rape can also be recognized as genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group. International legal instruments for prosecuting perpetrators for genocide were developed in the 1990s, with the Akayesu case of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda being widely considered as a precedent.[4] However, these legal instruments have so far only been used for international conflicts, thus putting the burden of proof in citing the international nature of conflict in order for prosecution to proceed.</p>
<p>## Definition of wartime sexual violence # Main article: Rape There is no consensus definition of wartime sexual violence, as there is variance in what forms of violence are included in the definition and variance in which violence is considered conflict-related.[5] The terms rape, sexual assault and sexual violence are frequently used interchangeably.[6] The Explanatory Note of the Rome Statute, which binds the International Criminal Court, defines rape as follows: </p><p> The perpetrator invaded the body of a person by conduct resulting in penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the perpetrator with a sexual organ, or of the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body.[7] and The invasion was committed by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power, against such person or another person, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment, or the invasion was committed against a person incapable of giving genuine consent.[7] </p><p>The concept of "invasion" is intended to be broad enough to be gender-neutral and the definition is understood to include situations where the victim may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or age-related incapacity.[8] A prominent data-set on conflict-related sexual violence, Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict (SVAC), builds on the ICC definition and covers seven forms of violence: "(a) rape, (b) sexual slavery, (c) forced prostitution, (d) forced pregnancy, (e) forced sterilization/abortion, (f) sexual mutilation, and (g) sexual torture."[5] The data-set defines conflict-related sexual violence as the sexual violence committed "armed actors (specifically, state militaries, rebel groups, and progovernment militias) during periods of conflict or immediately postconflict," thus excluding sexual violence by civilians.[5] More expansive definitions may define wartime sexual violence as being committed even by civilians if the conflict creates a sense of impunity.[5]</p>

Hi Im still learning how to structure letters! I am Rashard Kelly as my documentation i was given at what i was called my age of responsibility in Savannah Georgia. I married a girl in Alameda named Erika Johnson. We made the connection online on a site called [JWmatch.com](https://www.jwmatch.com/s/a/13906/us_s?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwyo60BhBiEiwAHmVLJUVKuEcZDx6T8rSSxErIqFZ48o8DAe9ve0zpmxxsOoUJX0Z3i1B6thoCRukQAvD_BwE). A man named Marvin Radovitch was a Jehovahs Witness and got [disfellowshipped](https://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/disfellowship-shunning.php) in [Savannah Georgia](https://savannahga.gov/). He was bored and started making friends on [AOL](https://www.wired.com/1999/10/aoldata/) and wanted me to have friends. I was good with girls, but there is a [mob that playboy runss](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/leader-las-vegas-playboy-bloods-street-gang-sentenced-23-years-prison) that captured all my girlfriends and like we paired but there was all this legal much in Jehovahs witnesses about Sexual Contact so my handler Willie Kelly Jr would not let me go off the street. And my Ibeji twin was abducted and raped according to the story she gave me. 
 <a href="https://static.projectmanagement.com/images/profile-photos/46666245_120718014114_p.jpg"><img src="https://static.projectmanagement.com/images/profile-photos/46666245_120718014114_p.jpg" style="width:180px;height:252px;margin-right:5px;padding:10px;" align="left" alt="Pineapple" /> 

She plays [OverWatch](https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/) and does not talk much but she is a singer now, thats how playboy control thier image. She is not in Rabbit Ears in [ThisVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuNx-_dqM90) but other girls are. I could not listen to the Jehovhas witnesses sexually bc the girls i was in field service with or Hospitality when my "Daddy" gave talks started breaking into my East Atlanta [CraftsmanBungalow](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/631-Moreland-Ave-SE-Atlanta-GA-30316/35832458_zpid/)
![631Moreland](https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e4047d7d1fcfcca0f0a8b0be2c694f27-cc_ft_768.webp) I was renting it from [Renters Warehouse](https://www.renterswarehouse.com/)
, Then my life started falling apart, they were having sex with me, I thought I was dreaming, then thier porno friends and dance ppl from hollywood started being mean to me...

[MoreLater](https://thakarashard.github.io/ricothaka/twitters.html) This was after i left [The San Gabriel Valley](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Valley)!

I was working for [NasaJPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/social) and caring for a small child. I know people from [Santa Anita Park](https://parks.lacounty.gov/arcadia-community-regional-park/) remember me palying with her everyday after work. Her mom started a sexual relationship at some point in the tiemline that I did not know about! We were driving a red mustang. I remember some guys in a Blue Grand MArquis rolled up on us in Van Nuys. Erika said i should quit working for a while and Grow. This was after a woman i thought was my mother died! Erika was never nice to me. She is family and I would never hurt her. She ran away when I hit her back. She was abusive bc after [Jehovahs Witnesses fell apart she felt stuck. ](https://x.com/Essence/status/1248047995804884992). I have no problem with her relationship status, but it left me crippled fiscally and immobile, i was 3 weeks late on my car payment and her boyfriend stole my honda fit. I had to let the mustang go for a Title loan bc the car was getting poisoned and i could not afford to commute in it. At least i would have the warranty with the new car. I had no carpayment b4. I get fired as soon as i get comfortable. Since i have a past with NAsa its hard to get work bc im not into porn. But I was advised that I was [Mars Mission Staff](https://github.com/nasa)! The people at the library are stingy with Computer time but the military is doing a silent workforce healing because we can be tracked via [GitHub](https://www.github.careers/careers-home)

If im working on Github and creating usable code im healthy with my employer. I have a contractor issue. Mori's Jose M Pi told me that I could not come back to the Military Base because I was late too often. Our Extended Stay room was getting poisoned and I was taking care of my child fulltime and had worked things out with the mission. I put her in a holistic daycare in Altedena with ponys and had a schedule to make sure she played outside. I have workedd Development Opeerations(Devops) most of my life and a computer is like your radio. Im isolated ive always depended on my employer for a steady connection to the internet, and my life organically grew around it. [Read about my victimization](https://thakarashard.github.io/ricothaka/worknotes#Mori) and bullying by the world of Criminal sex and striptease after I took a year off. No one ever belived I worked! And im always kicked off of social media and no one will talk to me. I think the lady in this video who is [removing my child](https://www.facebook.com/CaptainOfJoy/videos/1826699194158396) is a local sex slave. She is my friend at the very least. Here is the [DekalbCounty Court](https://www.facebook.com/CaptainOfJoy/videos/1826699224158393) removing my child with no notice! I was tossed in the Mental hospital about 3 months later. I was made homeless in stages! Im sacred and need help! [here is some of the story i compiled for Arcadia Police](https://thakarashard.github.io/compiling/Update-Arcadia-Police). Im getting wordy but The girl that took my child, i think it's [Normani](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/normani-cancels-bet-awards-performance-injury_n_6682d314e4b038babc7c6b01). I dont know to what extent but im intimate with her. Erika left me... And Normani has been life coaching me in certain areas. I signed a contract with her under the name Dyneesha... She goes by Kashdoll sometimes and keeps a check on my libraries and other things she getpoints for. Kinda like you guys and speeding tickets [Mashonga](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1826797320815250&set=pb.100004549987965.-2207520000&type=3)
