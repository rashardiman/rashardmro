## NOAA-21, NOAA-20, and Suomi NPP orbits
NOAA’s Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) provides global observations that serve as the backbone of both short- and long-term forecasts, including those that help us predict and prepare for severe weather events. The five satellites scheduled in the fleet are the currently-flying NOAA/NASA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite, NOAA-20, previously known as JPSS-1, NOAA-21, previously known as JPSS-2, and the upcoming JPSS-3 and JPSS-4 satellites.

Some of the former government employees who were fired, rehired and fired again said they're owed pay and their health plans have been frozen; Some workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who were fired in February, rehired in March and then fired for a second time in April, say the agency has missed some salary payments during that period, and failed to have their health insurance plans restored or provide basic paperwork...[ReadMore Evav Bush @nbcnews](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/noaa-workers-report-intentional-chaos-personnel-cuts-rcna201625) ![SAVE @noaa](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250417-noaa-headquarters-protest-mn-1407-85c3fd.jpg)

Weather & climate office hour 04/14/2025: Dismantling of NOAA, NASA, & climate research accelerates

The latest in a recurring series of live, virtual, & interactive "office hours" hosted by Dr. Daniel Swain on various topics related to extreme weather and climate. 04/14/2025 topic: Breaking news in recent days surrounding even deeper and more startling cuts to NOAA, NASA, FEMA, and other federal entities responsible for predicting, responding to, or studying weather, climate, wildfires, and disasters in the United States have been raising growing alarm. I'll discuss the latest in today's session, with a focus on potential short and long-term consequences of this proposed and/or unfolding large-scale dismantling of American science.

# 50 Years of GOES @noaa 
In 2025, NOAA celebrates 50 years of its heralded Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite program, known as GOES. For five decades, NOAA and NASA have partnered to advance NOAA satellite observations from geostationary orbit. GOES are our sentinels in the sky: keeping constant watch for severe weather and environmental hazards on Earth and dangerous space weather. - [@nasa GOES East and GOES West Coverage of Western Hemisphere @noaa on YOUTUBE](https://youtu.be/2lOUkJzhfXM) ![GOES_R](https://www.goes-r.gov/imagesContent/multimedia/goesSeriesLogos/provingGround/color/03-med.png)
