The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) [1, 2] has a suite of instruments
making observations at Mars, and it provides data-relay services for Mars
landers and rovers. MRO was launched on August 12, 2005. The orbiter
successfully went into orbit around Mars on March 10, 2006 and began
reducing its orbit altitude and circularizing the orbit in preparation for the
science mission. The orbit changing was accomplished through a process called aerobraking, in preparation for the “science mission” starting in November
2006, followed by the “relay mission” starting in November 2008. MRO
participated in the Mars Science Laboratory touchdown and surface mission
that began in August 2012 (Chapter 7).

Each pixel in the mosaic is about the size of a typical parking space, providing unprecedented resolution of the martian surface at the global scale.
